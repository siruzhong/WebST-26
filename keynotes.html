      <b>Abstract</b>: What makes a video popular? What drives collective attention online? What are the similarities and differences between clicks and transactions in a market? This talk aims to address these three questions. First, I will discuss a physics-inspired stochastic time series model that explains and forecasts the seemingly unpredictable patterns of viewership over time. This model provides novel metrics for predicting expected popularity gains per share and assessing sensitivity to promotions. Next, I will describe new measurement studies and machine learning models that analyze how networks of online items influence each other's attention. Finally, I will introduce a macroscopic view of attention, offering mathematical descriptions of market equilibriums and distributed optimization. These results lay the groundwork for our ongoing research into the computational view of attention markets and potential mechanisms for fostering a healthy online ecosystem.

      <td colspan="2">
      <b>Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have shown great potential in time series modeling by capturing complex temporal dependencies and generating realistic sequences through iterative denoising. In this talk, we explore innovative strategies that integrate various guidance mechanisms—targeted interventions that steer the model toward desired properties—into the diffusion process for both time series generation and forecasting. By incorporating different forms of guidance, such as text/embedding-based prompting, statistical constraints, and task-aware feedback, we enable flexible, personalized, and domain-aware time series generation. For forecasting, we leverage implicit guidance techniques to enhance stability, mitigate biases, and improve predictive accuracy. We will discuss the underlying principles, technical challenges, and practical benefits of these approaches, highlighting their potential to address real-world, cross-domain challenges.

      <b>Abstract</b>: Recent advances in deep learning and large-scale temporal data have significantly accelerated progress in time series analysis. Yet, most existing approaches remain domain-specific and lack the capacity for generalization, contextual adaptation, and complex reasoning. In this talk, we aim to present a unified paradigm for next-generation time series modeling. We first introduce ConvTimeNet, a deep convolutional architecture designed to capture rich multivariate dependencies. To improve transferability, we showcase self-supervised pretraining methods, including TimeMAE and TimeDART, which learn universal temporal representations from unlabeled data. We then highlight InstructTime, a multimodal framework that incorporates external contextual signals—such as natural language instructions—for enhanced adaptability. Finally, we discuss reasoning-based models such as TableTime and TimeReasoner, which support multivariate time series classification and time series forecasting with structured reasoning.

      <b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, the rapid expansion of urban spatio-temporal data has been driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile connectivity. However, with the ongoing evolution of urban structures and socio-economic development, urban growth has become the new norm in regional development. Existing spatio-temporal learning models often lack sufficient awareness of urban growth and the autonomous evolution capabilities to adapt dynamic data, resulting in limited support for long-term urban renewal and optimization. To merge the gap, this talk proposes a spatio-temporal evolving learning framework from the perspective of urban growth. It aims to effectively couple multi-scale socio-economic factors to enable fine-grained modeling of dynamic urban expansion. In addition, it introduces the complementary learning for enhancing general intelligence and endows models with the ability to "learn as data arrives." To achieve sustainable urban governance, our talk also presents an agent-based collaborative framework for urban renewal based on the interaction between large and small models. This approach combines small model driven fine-grained urban growth simulation with strategic optimization guided by LLMs, leveraging both worlds of small and large models and driving high-quality development of urban systems over the medium to long term.
